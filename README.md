# Natural Language Processing Data Project

**"Natural Language Prodigies"**

**Authors**: [Heath Jones](mailto:), [Yasitha De Alwis](mailto:), [Nick Kai](mailto:nhknicholas@gmail.com), [Tristan Trechsel](mailto:tristantrechsel@gmail.com)

## Overview



## Business Problem

Develop a highly accurate and reliable NLP model to automate the categorization of medical research papers into one of four major disease categories, thereby accelerating research, enhancing accessibility, and facilitating a more efficient allocation of medical expertise and resources.

## Data

The National Transportation Safety Board maintains records of all investigations into aircraft incidents and accidents in the United States since 1962. Each event has a unique ID associated with it. The data contains various information about the aircraft involved in the event, as well as the severity of the incident by numbers and types of injuries.

## Methods

This project uses a variety of data cleaning methods to organize and subset the data such as: 
- Dropping irrelevant properties.
- Filling in null values.
- Slicing, dicing, and filtering. 
- Created new columns to analyze injury severity and aircraft damage severity by manufacturer.
